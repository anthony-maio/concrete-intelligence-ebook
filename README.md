## About This Book

This book is a pragmatic, step-by-step playbook for deploying AI in asset-intensive industries such as manufacturing, construction, logistics, agriculture, and energy. Unlike general AI books, this guide focuses on real-world outcomes and field-tested recommendations for environments where reliability, safety, and measurable ROI are critical.

### Who This Book Is For

- **Strategic leaders** seeking to understand AI's potential in traditional industries
- **Operations managers** looking for practical, proven AI implementations
- **Industry professionals** in manufacturing, construction, logistics, agriculture, and energy

### What Makes This Book Different

Rather than focusing on theoretical concepts, *Concrete Intelligence* delivers measurable outcomes:

- **50% reduction** in unplanned downtime
- **99.5% accuracy** in quality control
- **20% reduction** in energy consumption
- **Prevention** of catastrophic equipment failures

### Key Principles

1. **Outcomes Over Technology** - Success depends on organizational readiness, not just technical solutions
2. **Start Small** - Begin with small, proof-of-value pilots
3. **Good Enough Data** - Your data only needs to be "good enough" to solve the business problem
4. **Act Now** - Waiting to adopt AI costs more than investing upfront
